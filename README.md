# Registro-Vagones
Registro de Vagon in HTML,PHP,jQuery,Bootstrap and MySQL

This program consists of a page that the client can use to register wagons on a dock.
When the wagons arrive the customer verifies them with his Raspberry pi and completes information of these.
This program allows the customer to keep an efficient register of wagon inventory on a dock. When the user enters the data these will be recorded in a database that will be automatically assigned to the program.
All the information of each wagon will be saved in a table in the database. Each car is distinguished by its own number and its respective information.
In addition to all this, the client will be able to extract information from each wagon to verify it and make changes if necessary. These changes will be presented in the database once corrected.
